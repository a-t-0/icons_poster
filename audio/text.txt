Welcome to this presentation on the robustness of spiking neural networks. We will look into leveraging brain-adaptation principles to increase radiation resistance of neuromorphic space hardware. I will explain how I came up with this research, why it is relevant,  what it solves, and how that is done. 

During neuro-science lectures at Leiden University, I learned how brain adaptation can sometimes allow people to partially recover from brain lesions.
As part of my space exploration education, I learned how radiation can damage space hardware and result in faulty operating conditions. And in the cognitive computing specialisation I learned how spiking neural networks can be used to perform energy efficient computations. Putting these three insights together, I wondered if brain adaptation principles could be applied in spiking neural networks to increase the radiation robustness of neuromorphic space hardware.

Spacecrafts are typically heavily energy constrained. This makes neuromorphic hardware an interesting candidate for space applications. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in launching neuromorphic hardware into space.

To test the hypothesis, a distributed minimum dominating set approximation algorithm is selected. This algorithm is presented by Alipour.
